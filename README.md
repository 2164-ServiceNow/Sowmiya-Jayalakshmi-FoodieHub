### User Stories:

1. **Explore Menus by Cuisine**  
   *As a user, I want to browse a variety of cuisines (e.g., Italian, Indian, Chinese), so I can easily discover new dishes.*  
   *Example Flow*: The user selects a cuisine from a dropdown and sees the menu filtered by that cuisine.



2. **Search for a Dish**  
   *As a user, I want to search for specific dishes by name, so I can quickly find what I’m craving.*  
   *Example Flow*: A search bar allows users to type a dish name (e.g., "Pizza"), and matching results are displayed.



3. **Filter by Category**  
   *As a user, I want to filter dishes by categories like appetizers, main course, or desserts, so I can narrow down my options.*  
   *Example Flow*: Clicking on a category tab updates the menu view to show only relevant items.


4. **View Dish Details**  
   *As a user, I want to click on a dish to see detailed information, such as ingredients, calories, and price, so I can make informed choices.*  
   *Example Flow*: Clicking on a dish opens a modal or navigates to a page with detailed information.


5. **See Special Offers**  
   *As a user, I want to see ongoing special offers or discounts on dishes, so I can make cost-effective choices.*  
   *Example Flow*: A "Special Offers" section highlights discounted dishes.


6. **Mark Favorites Locally**  
   *As a user, I want to save my favorite dishes locally, so I can access them easily during future visits.*  
   *Example Flow*: Clicking a heart icon marks a dish as a favorite and stores it in the browser using localStorage.


7. **Sort Dishes**  
   *As a user, I want to sort dishes by price, popularity, or calories, so I can easily compare my options.*  
   *Example Flow*: A dropdown menu allows users to sort dishes dynamically.


8. **Quick Menu Refresh**  
   *As a user, I want to refresh the menu quickly, so I can ensure I’m viewing the latest dishes or offers.*
